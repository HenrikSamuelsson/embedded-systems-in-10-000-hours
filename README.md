# Embedded Systems in-10 000 hours

My journey to learning embedded systems development in 10 000 hours.

All more complex skills takes a lot of time and practise to learn. There is no quick fix, you must put in hours of focused work. As rule of thumb it takes 10 000 hours of dedicated work to master something hard ## [(Gladwell, 2008)](references.md#gladwell-2008).
