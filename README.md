# Embedded Systems in-10 000 hours

My journey to learning embedded systems development in 10 000 hours.

All more complex skill takes time and practise to learn. There is no quick fix, you must put in hours of focused work. As rule of thumb it takes 10 000 hours to master something hard (Gladwell, 2008).
