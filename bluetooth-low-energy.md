# Bluetooth Low Energy

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio enables devices to exchange data wirelessly.

## BLE Protocol Stack

## Physical Layer

The physical layer (PHY) is the lowest bottom layer in the BLE Protocol stack. This layer is about actual physical methods to transmit the information by the use of radio.

The BLE standard defines three different types of PHY radios:

1. LE 1M PHY
2. LE 2M PHY
3. LE Coded PHY

## BLE Device Addresses

A BLE device will have an unique address, represented by in a 48-bit value. 

This device address comes in different types and subtypes:

- public
- random
  - static
  - private
    - resolvable
    - non-resolvable
