# Introduction

Embedded systems are today all around us, at the workplace, in our vehicles, and in our homes.

Anything that is electrically powered is today likely to contain an embedded systems. Car motors, elevators, household appliances, batteries, lamps, speakers, cameras, and the like, will include one or more embedded systems.

There is not a single clear definition of what an embedded system is, perhaps because embedded systems comes in so many different variants.

Qing Li and Carolyn Yao provides the following definition in their book [(Li, 2003)](references.md#li-2003):

> Embedded systems are computing systems with tightly coupled hardware and software integration, that are designed to perform a dedicated function. The word embedded reflects the fact that these systems are usually an integral part of a larger system, known as the embedding system. Multiple embedded systems can coexist in an embedding system.
