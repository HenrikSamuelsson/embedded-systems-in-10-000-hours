# C Programming

C is a general purpose programming language. It is commonly used in embedded systems projects.

## Compilation

Code for C programs is written by a developer and stored in what is known as a *source file*. The code in the source file is aimed at being readable by humans, but a machine can not run it. Before the code can be run it needs to be converted to another format that the machine accepts. The tool that is responsible for the conversion is known as a *compiler*, and the process is known as *compilation*. The compiler takes the source file as input. From the input the compiler produces output in the form of a file that is ready to be run by a machine. This output from the compiler is termed *executable*.

## Tool Chains

From the previous section on [compilation](#compilation) it can be noted that development is done in chain of events; source file creation, compilation, and finally program execution. Each step requires dedicated tools. The complete set of tools used for development is known as the *tool chain*.

### Basic Tool Chain

A basic tool chain for C programming development is presented in this section.

As a base there will need to be machine to run the tools and this will be a general-purpose computer, type of computer does not matter much, but it should come with a proper keyboard to enable productivity.

#### Text Editor

The source files are written in a text editor on the computer. The text must be in *plain text* format, which loosely speaking means a format based on only letters, numbers, and a limited set of symbols.

There are a lot of different text editors to chose from exactly which one to use is mostly a matter of personal taste and what is commonly used on the type of computer used for development.

All computers tend to come with with a basic text editor already installed by default. But it is worth the time to learn a more advanced text editor dedicated for programming to increase productivity. Some examples of text editors for C programming are; Visual Studio Code, Vim, Sublime Text, and Notepad++.
