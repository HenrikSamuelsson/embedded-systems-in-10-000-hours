# C Programming

C is a general purpose programming language. It is commonly used in embedded systems projects.

## Compilation

Code for C programs is written by a developer and stored in what is known as a *source file*. The code in the source file is aimed at being readable by humans, but a machine can not run it. Before the code can be run it needs to be converted to another format that the machine accepts. The tool that is responsible for the conversion is known as a *compiler*, and the process is known as *compilation*. The compiler takes the source file as input. From the input the compiler produces output in the form of a file that is ready to be run by a machine. This output from the compiler is termed *executable*.
