# C Programming

C is a general purpose programming language. It is commonly used in embedded systems projects.

## Compilation

Code for C programs is written by a developer and stored in what is known as a *source file*. The code in the source file is readable by humans but not by a machine. Before the code can be run it needs to be converted to another format that the machine accepts. The tool that is responsible for the conversion is known as a *compiler*, and the process is known as *compilation*.
