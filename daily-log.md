Created repository for this project, named embedded-systems-in-10-000-hours.

## 2024-02-07 Session 1 (1h)

Created document to hold list of abbreviations from the field of embedded systems.

## 2024-02-07 Session 2 (1h)

Created introduction note, explaining what an embedded system is.

## 2024-02-08 Session 1 (1h)

Bought the book Intermediate C Programming in E-book format. Turned out that required an special app to read, called Bookshelf, so had to install this as well.

Created a new note called c-programming.md to collect material related to the C programming language.

## 2024-02-08 Session 2 (1h)

Read up on C Programming in the book Intermediate C-Programming [(Lu, 2024)](references.md/#lu-2024), took notes in c-programming.md.

## 2024-02-09 Session 1 (1h)

Read up on tool chains for C-development, especially on text-editors used to write source code, took some notes in c-programming.md.

## 2024-02-09 Session 2 (1h)

Read up on the Linux command `sed` that can be used to automate editing of files. Wrote about `sed` in [linux-commands](linux-commands.md).

## 2024-02-09 Session 3 (1h)

Read up on C programming tool chains and took notes in [c-programming.md](c-programming.md#tool-chains.)

## 2024-02-10 Session 1 (1h)

Worked on improving understanding best practices for running GCC on Windows. Read up on what MSYS2 is and upgraded my MSYS2 installation on my Dell work laptop.

## 2024-02-10 Session 2 (1h)

Playing around with the Linux command `sed` by the use of WSL running under Windows 10.

## 2024-02-11 Session 1 (1h)

Read-up on BLE in the book Intro to Bluetooth Low Energy [(Afaneh, 2023)](references.md#afaneh-2023).

## 2024-02-11 Session 2 (1h)

Continued reading up on BLE in the book Intro to Bluetooth Low Energy [(Afaneh, 2023)](references.md#afaneh-2023).

## 2024-02-12 Session 1 (2h)

Continued reading up on BLE in the book Intro to Bluetooth Low Energy [(Afaneh, 2023)](references.md#afaneh-2023). Also downloaded and had a brief look at The Bluetooth Low Energy Primer [(Bluetooth SIG, 2023)](references.md#bluetooth-sig-2023).

## 2024-02-13 Session 1 (1h)

Learned and took notes on BLE device addresses based on information from the book Intro to Bluetooth Low Energy [(Afaneh, 2023)](references.md#afaneh-2023).

## 2024-02-14 Session 1 (1h)

Learned and took notes on BLE packet formats based on information from the book Intro to Bluetooth Low Energy [(Afaneh, 2023)](references.md#afaneh-2023).

## 2024-02-15 Session 1 (2h)

Read up on details on BLE advertising in the book Intro to Bluetooth Low Energy [(Afaneh, 2023)](references.md#afaneh-2023). Then also looked into use cases for BLE technology and took some notes on this topic.

## 2024-02-16 Session 1 (1h)

Read up on on mechanics for BLE connections in the book Intro to Bluetooth Low Energy [(Afaneh, 2023)](references.md#afaneh-2023). Learned about *connection events* where the peripheral and central exchange packets during a connection, and that there is a pause between connection events known as the *connection interval*.
